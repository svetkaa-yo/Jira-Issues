Jira Issues Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of Jira Issues that I have gathered from various projects. These tasks represent diverse situations I have encountered during my work and showcase my experience in task management, planning, and tracking progress through the Jira system.

About the Project
In this repository, you will find several Jira Issues, each of which illustrates:

The problem that needed to be solved.
The status of the task and the stages of its execution.
Correspondence with the team (if available).
The labels and priorities assigned to the tasks.
Structure
Each task is represented as a separate issue and contains information about:

The task ID (e.g., JIRA-1234).
The type of task (e.g., bug, improvement, new feature).
A description of the problem or requirement.
The task status (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").
Comments and solutions applied to resolve the issue.
